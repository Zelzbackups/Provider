<h1>How to use proxy: First make sure you select one of the proxies, Palladium is better for discord and gaming and Alloy is a bit slower but better when watching youtube, and doing more normal web tasks.  Next, make sure you have the url you want to enter, make sure you have https:// before the url (https://coolmathgames.com/) then press go and enjoy the private secure browsing experience!!</h1>

<h1>UPDATE WARNING!  It wont show until you press the three dots in the corner of your screen, More tools and Clear Browsing data then select clear cache!</h1>

<h1>Coming Soon: Maybe particles.js update</h1>
